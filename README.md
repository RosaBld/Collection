Hi there!

You are on my project The Collection.

This little project mixes JS, HTML et SASS langages. 

The concept is quite simple : you can here find a little list about a subject that I got to chose and like.

Maybe you won't agree about them, but that's not really the point.


So for this project, I started to create the HTML skeleton.

Then, I added the JS by creating an array of my list. With this list quite detailed, the next step was to add it to the html without touching the html. That was the hard part.

So, with function and all, I created different divs, and elements for my texts, images, and links, by taking care of every child and parent.

Once everything seemed to look in order, it was time to tacle the SASS and making it responsive.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to battle with the bonus exercice. I hope to find some more time to do it eventually and finish this exercice completely.

Hope you enjoy!
